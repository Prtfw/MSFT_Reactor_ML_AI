The question might seem trivial at first: just look at the percentage of predictions or classifications that it gets right. But examining only the accuracy score of an ML model tells only part of the story of its usefulness in the real world. All models produce false positives and false negatives; which of those should you tune your model to favor? If your model is to be used to identify individuals carrying an infectious disease, fewer false negatives at the cost of more false positives could be desirable. If you are making classifications in support of criminal cases, accepting more false negatives to avoid false positives might be essential.\n\n> **Learning objective:** By the end of this section, you should have a basic understanding of the different means of assessing the accuracy of an ML model and how the ROC curve can help you understand their relationship in your own models.\n\n## Accuracy\n\nTo assess the accuracy of a model, we need to create and fit one first."

In some cases, avoiding false negatives is paramount (such as when working with infectious diseases). In other cases, avoided false positives is essential (such as in instances involving the criminal-justice system).

This means that the top-left corner of the plot is the “ideal” point: a false positive rate of 0 (zero), and a true positive rate of 1. Such an ideal is rarely (if ever) realized in practice, but it is the theoretical goal.\n\nA key concept with ROC curves is *area under the curve* (AUC), with a larger AUC representing a better model. The slope of the ROC curve is also important because it's better to maximize the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate.\n\nLet's find the ROC curve and AUC for the model we just trained."
